dotfiles for commonly used programs

I use GNU Stow to maintain a symlink with my git repo
see [this link](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) for a guide to do this yourself. It provides a much cleaner way to keep your dotfiles up to date. I setup the gitignore to ignore plugins and other files that will automatically download on install 


## vim

vim is life

I split my modularized my .vimrc configurations and just sourced them all in my main .vimrc. It makes things much cleaner and easier to follow.
